# Novellus
 
Welcome to my github page!

Novellus is a 2D / Text-Based fantasy life sim, with heavy influence from sandbox games like: Daggerfall, Rimworld, Crusader Kings, Mount & Blade, and Corruption of Champions. 

When the game is finished, you'll be able to select from 15 different species and mixed races (Elves + Dwarves = Gnomes), create a high quality portrait for dialogue and an animated sprite for gameplay, engage in 3 different forms of combat (Melee, Ranged, Magical) or talk down your enemies peacefully, interact with and influence a fully simulated ecosystem and economy, and create your story as you do so. With three modes of play (Sandbox, Storymode, Multiplayer), you should be able create all sorts of stories which are saved in the History Logger, which you can use to help you write stories or simply roleplay your characters. 

The game is currently in pre-alpha, there are NO downloads available try it (yet). 

If you wish to assist me in this project, get ahold of me on discord, @astralsomnia and your contributions will earn you a cut of royalties when the game is eventually finished and sold.
